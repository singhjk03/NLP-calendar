# NLP-calendar

To enable users to interact with the calendar through conversational language, the system will be designed to recognize and interpret natural language inputs. This means users can add, modify, and query events using phrases and sentences similar to those used when speaking to a human assistant. For example, a user could say, "Schedule a meeting with John for next Monday at 10 AM," or "Move my dentist appointment to 2 PM on Friday."

The system will then process these inputs, understand their intent, and execute the appropriate actions within the calendar application. This functionality aims to make the scheduling process more intuitive by reducing the need for users to navigate through traditional calendar interfaces manually. Instead, they can simply speak or type their requests in a natural, conversational manner.

By aligning the interaction with natural human behavior, this approach seeks to enhance user experience, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Users will be able to manage their schedules with greater ease, as the system will handle the complexity of interpreting and executing commands, thus streamlining the entire scheduling process.
